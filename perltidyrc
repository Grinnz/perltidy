# perltidyrc file for perltidy itself
# Note:
# - This is not named .perltidyrc because that could interfere
#   with testing. This has to be requested with -pro=perltidyrc
# - Formatting without these parameters remains stable, so it is not
#   necessary to format with these parameters every time. But it should
#   be done before a commit.
